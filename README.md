# T@skk1ll

## Simple application that terminates the current active window when F1 is pressed.

T@skk1ll is a very lightweight application at a little more than 1 MB. No installer is needed because it is just an executable. T@skk1ll terminates the current active window when F1 is pressed. Not only does it terminate the one window, it also terminates all the windows of that application. To make T@skk1ll be able to terminate administrator apps, just press Control+Shift+Alt+a and a prompt will pop up asking to run T@skk1ll as admin. If you want to exit out of T@skk1ll at any time, press Control+Shift+Alt+e. If you don't want to run T@skk1ll every time you start your PC, press Control+Shift+Alt+s and it will run on startup. If you ever need to see these hotkeys, just press Control+Shift+Alt+h and it will show you a help window.

**Notice:** When terminating a Windows Store application, T@skk1ll will terminate all Windows Store Applications.
